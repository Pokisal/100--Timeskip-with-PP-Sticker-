As always thanks to Souzooka for creating the original Timeskip this is based on also thanks to the people I stole code off of on stackoverflow lmao

Important information!!!:
Hotkey to swap between PP Sticker and general stuff tab and Clothes Horse/Gourmet Tab is - this can be changed by right clicking on the label which will bring up a text box.
YOU CANNOT USE THE KEY USED FOR THE HOTKEY FOR ANY PURPOSE WHILE THE PROGRAM IS OPEN!
This is very buggy and I can't fix it because you are not allowed to add KeyEventArgs to a label click event sometimes the key won't be what you put in
It also has to be a key you can insert into a textbox.

To check Transmissionary progress hover your mouse over the Transmissionary label.

All Clothes Horse labels can be hovered over to tell you the location/locations you can find the specific clothing item.

TBD: Actually give the Clothes Horse and Gourmet labels an actual order.
Besides that I'm basically done with this for now.
